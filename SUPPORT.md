## Getting Help with GenPRES

Thank you for using GenPRES! This document provides guidance on how to get help and support. The current document is a first draft and will be expanded over time to include more details on support processes, contact points, and best practices.

**Note that this repository only contains the source code and documentation for GenPRES. It does not include professional support services. Also, the repository is not intended for direct clinical use without appropriate validation and regulatory approval.**

## Before Asking for Help

   - [README.md](README.md) - Getting started and overview
   - [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) - System architecture
   - [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) - Contribution guidelines
   - `docs/` - Detailed documentation

2. **Search existing resources**
   - [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/halcwb/GenPRES2/issues) - Known bugs and feature requests
   - [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/halcwb/GenPRES2/discussions) - Past questions and discussions
   - [Closed Issues](https://github.com/halcwb/GenPRES2/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) - Previously resolved problems

3. **Verify your setup**
   - Ensure you have the correct .NET version (see `global.json`)
   - Check that all dependencies are installed

## How to Ask Questions

### GitHub Discussions (Preferred)

Use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/halcwb/GenPRES2/discussions) for:

- **General questions** about using GenPRES
- **Design discussions** and architectural questions
- **Feature ideas** and brainstorming
- **Clinical use cases** and scenarios
- **Best practices** and implementation advice

**Create a new discussion** in the appropriate category:

- **Q&A**: Questions about using or developing GenPRES
- **Ideas**: Feature requests and suggestions
- **Show and Tell**: Share your implementations or extensions
- **General**: Other discussions

**Include in your question:**

- Clear, descriptive title
- What you're trying to accomplish
- What you've tried so far
- Relevant code snippets or configuration
- Error messages (if applicable)
- Environment details (OS, .NET version, browser)

### GitHub Issues

Use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/halcwb/GenPRES2/issues) **only** for:

- **Bug reports** - Something is broken or incorrect
- **Feature requests** - Specific, well-defined new functionality
- **Documentation improvements** - Errors or gaps in documentation

**Do NOT use issues for:**

- General questions (use Discussions instead)
- Support requests (use Discussions instead)
- Debugging help (use Discussions first)

When creating an issue, use the appropriate template and provide:

- Clear reproduction steps for bugs
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Environment information
- Screenshots or error messages
- Relevant code snippets

## Clinical and Safety Questions

For questions related to:

- **Clinical accuracy** of dosing calculations
- **Safety concerns** with medication recommendations
- **Medical literature** references or validation

Please:

1. Review existing clinical documentation in `docs/scenarios/` and `docs/mdr/`
2. Search for related issues with `safety` or `clinical` labels
3. Create a discussion in the Q&A category with `[Clinical]` prefix
4. Be prepared to provide clinical context and references

**For urgent safety concerns**, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for responsible disclosure process.
