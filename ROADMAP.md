### Release Cadence

- **Major releases**: Annually or as needed
- **Minor releases**: Quarterly
- **Patch releases**: As needed (especially for critical bugs)

## Development Principles

Our roadmap is guided by:

1. **Safety First**: Patient safety is paramount in all decisions
2. **Evidence-Based**: Grounded in clinical literature and guidelines
3. **Quality Over Speed**: Thorough validation before release
4. **Community-Driven**: Responsive to user needs and feedback
5. **Regulatory Compliance**: Maintain MDR and quality standards
6. **Open & Transparent**: Public roadmap and decision-making
