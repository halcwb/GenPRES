# Contributing to GenPRES

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the GenPRES project! This document provides guidelines for contributing to our open source medication order entry solution.

## About GenPRES

GenPRES is an open source software initiative to enable a **Safe and Efficient** medication prescriptions, preparation and administration workflow. The project aims to reduce medication errors through Clinical Decision Support Software (CDSS) that handles:

1. Looking up rules and constraints
2. Calculations
3. Verification of correct applications of rules and constraints and subsequent calculations

**Important**: GenPRES is being developed to comply with Medical Device Regulation (MDR) certification guidelines. Documentation and processes related to MDR compliance will be added to the project as development progresses. Contributors should be aware that all code changes must adhere to medical device software development standards and quality requirements.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before contributing, ensure you have the following installed:

- **.NET SDK**: 9.0.0 or later
- **Node.js**: 18.x, 22.x, or 23.x (LTS versions recommended)
- **npm**: 10.x or later

### Setting Up the Development Environment

1. Fork this repository
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Set up the demo environment variables:

**Important**: Proper environment variable setup is critical for the application to function correctly. Missing or incorrect environment variables can cause resource loading failures (see [Issue #44](https://github.com/halcwb/GenPRES2/issues/44)).

#### Option 1: Direct Export (Temporary)

```bash
export GENPRES_URL_ID=1xhFPiF-e5rMkk7BRSfbOF-XGACeHInWobxRbjYU0_w4
export GENPRES_LOG=0
export GENPRES_PROD=0
export GENPRES_DEBUG=1
```

#### Option 2: Using direnv (Recommended for Persistent Setup)

Install [direnv](https://direnv.net/) and create a `.envrc` file in the project root:

```bash
# .envrc file
export GENPRES_URL_ID=1xhFPiF-e5rMkk7BRSfbOF-XGACeHInWobxRbjYU0_w4
export GENPRES_LOG=0
export GENPRES_PROD=0
export GENPRES_DEBUG=1
```

**Don't forget** to [hook direnv](https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html) to your shell!

Then allow direnv to load the variables:

```bash
direnv allow
```

**Environment Variable Requirements**:

- `GENPRES_URL_ID`: Google Sheet ID for demo data (required)
- `GENPRES_PROD=0`: **Mandatory** for demo version - prevents production data access
- `GENPRES_LOG=0`: Controls logging verbosity
- `GENPRES_DEBUG=1`: Enables debug mode for development

**Troubleshooting**: If you encounter "cannot find column" errors during startup, verify that all environment variables are properly set. Missing `GENPRES_URL_ID` or incorrect values can cause resource loading failures.

### Start the application

```bash
dotnet run
```

Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173`

## Code Contribution Guidelines

### Repository Structure

**Important: an opt-in strategy is used** in the `.gitignore` file, i.e. you have to specifically define what should be included instead or the other way around!!

This project follows specific organizational patterns:

- **Library Structure**: Use the `Informedica.{Domain}.Lib` naming convention
- **Domain Libraries**: GenSolver, GenOrder, GenUnits, ZIndex, Utils
- **Separate Test Projects**: Each library has its own test project
- **Opt-in .gitignore**: *You must explicitly define what should be included!!*

### Coding Standards

#### F# Development

Follow our [F# Coding Instructions](.github/instructions/fsharp-coding.instructions.md) which include:

- Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
- Keep lines under 120 characters
- Use meaningful names with PascalCase for types/modules, camelCase for local bindings
- Use discriminated unions for domain modeling
- Prefer immutable data structures
- Use Result<'T, 'Error> for operations that can fail
- Write comprehensive unit tests using Expecto
- Use property-based testing for complex logic

#### Commit Messages

Follow our [Commit Message Instructions](.github/instructions/commit-message.instructions.md):

Use conventional commits format:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`

**Scopes for GenPRES**:

- Library scopes: `gensolver`, `genorder`, `genunits`, `zindex`, `utils`
- Application scopes: `client`, `server`, `api`, `ui`, `config`
- Infrastructure scopes: `deps`, `docker`, `github`, `build`, `deploy`

**Examples**:

```
feat(genorder): add pediatric dosage calculation
fix(genunits): correct mg/ml to mmol/L conversion for NaCl
docs(readme): update installation instructions
test(gensolver): add property-based tests for constraint solving
```

### Testing Requirements

- Write unit tests for all public functions
- Use Expecto as the testing framework
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Use property-based testing with FsCheck for mathematical operations
- Ensure tests are readable and maintainable

### Documentation

- Use XML documentation for public APIs
- Include examples in documentation when helpful
- Document complex algorithms or business rules
- Keep comments focused on "why" rather than "what"
- Update README.md if adding new features or changing setup procedures

## Domain-Specific Guidelines

### Medical Safety Considerations

When contributing to medical functionality:

- **Patient Safety First**: All changes affecting dosage calculations, medication lookup, or clinical decision support must be thoroughly tested
- **Precision Matters**: Use appropriate units of measure and maintain calculation accuracy
- **Validation Required**: Implement comprehensive input validation for medical data
- **Error Handling**: Provide clear, actionable error messages for medical professionals
- **MDR Compliance**: Ensure all medical-related changes align with Medical Device Regulation requirements

### Mathematical Operations

- Use units of measure for all physical quantities
- Ensure calculations preserve unit safety
- Test with edge cases (zero, negative, infinity)
- Include precision and accuracy considerations
- Document mathematical properties being maintained

### Performance Considerations

- Use sequences (seq) for large datasets
- Consider async patterns for I/O operations
- Profile before optimizing
- Maintain functional approaches while being pragmatic about performance

## Pull Request Process

- **Proposed Solution**: Your suggested approach
- **Alternatives**: Other approaches you've considered
- **Safety Considerations**: Any patient safety implications

## Development Workflow

### Git Workflow

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create a feature branch**: `git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name`
3. **Make changes** following our coding guidelines
4. **Commit** using conventional commit messages
5. **Push** to your fork
6. **Create a pull request** to the main repository

### Opt-in .gitignore Strategy

This project uses an opt-in strategy for `.gitignore`:

- You must explicitly define what should be included
- When adding new files, ensure they're properly included in git
- Proprietary medication cache files are excluded for licensing reasons

### Environment Configuration

For development, use these environment variables. Proper configuration is essential to avoid resource loading issues (see [Issue #44](https://github.com/halcwb/GenPRES2/issues/44) for troubleshooting guidance):

```bash
export GENPRES_URL_ID=1IZ3sbmrM4W4OuSYELRmCkdxpN9SlBI-5TLSvXWhHVmA  # Demo data URL
export GENPRES_LOG=0          # Logging level
export GENPRES_PROD=0         # Must be 0 for demo version
export GENPRES_DEBUG=1        # Enable debug mode
```

#### Common Environment Variable Issues

**Missing GENPRES_URL_ID**: Will cause "cannot find column" errors when the application tries to load resources from Google Sheets.

**Incorrect GENPRES_PROD value**: Setting this to anything other than `0` in development may cause authentication or data access issues.

#### Alternative Setup Methods

Many developers prefer using tools like `direnv` for automatic environment variable loading:

1. Install direnv: `brew install direnv` (macOS) or equivalent for your OS
2. Create `.envrc` file in project root with the variables above
3. Run `direnv allow` to enable automatic loading
4. Variables will be loaded automatically when entering the project directory

For other environment variable management approaches, see [Issue #44](https://github.com/halcwb/GenPRES2/issues/44) for community discussions and recommendations.
