# EHR Medication Prescribing Research: Safety and Efficiency Evidence Analysis

**Bottom Line Up Front**: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) with computerized prescribing capabilities demonstrate **substantial medication error reduction (55-99% in most studies)** but show **mixed evidence for patient-level harm prevention**. Success depends heavily on implementation quality, clinical decision support optimization, and user training rather than specific vendor choice. While technology-induced errors emerge as new safety concerns, the overall evidence supports EHR adoption when properly implemented with attention to workflow integration and alert management.

This comprehensive analysis examines peer-reviewed research from 2008-2025 on EHR medication prescribing across all major platforms, synthesizing evidence from systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and primary studies to assess patient safety outcomes, workflow efficiency, comparative effectiveness, clinical decision support performance, user experience, and implementation best practices.

## Patient Safety: Dramatic Error Reduction with Limited Harm Prevention Evidence

**Electronic prescribing systems achieve remarkable medication error reduction**, with the most rigorous systematic reviews showing consistent improvements across diverse healthcare settings. [Meta-analysis for the effect of electronic prescribing on medication error](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6816608/) showed a significant reduction in overall medication errors (RR 0.24 (95% CI 0.13, 0.46), I2 98%, n = 11), with high heterogeneity. Individual studies within this meta-analysis show even more dramatic improvements, with [23 studies showing a significant relative risk reduction of 13% to 99% for medication errors](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2528040/).

**The scope of error reduction spans multiple medication management phases**. [Of 10 studies of prescribing error rates, 9 reported a reduction](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7810459/) but variable denominators precluded meta-analysis. Research demonstrates that [medication errors per 1000 hospital days decreased from 17.9 to 15.4 (14.0%; p<0.030)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3116263/), while near misses per 1000 hospital days increased from 9.0 to 12.5 (38.9%; p<0.037), indicating improved error detection capabilities alongside prevention.

**However, patient-level harm reduction remains elusive in the data**. [Meta-analysis of 5 studies reporting change in actual harm post-EMS showed no reduced risk](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7810459/) (RR: 1.22, 95% CI: 0.18–8.38, P = .8). This critical gap between process improvements and patient outcomes appears consistently across studies. While [six of the nine studies that analysed the effects on potential ADEs showed a significant relative risk reduction of 35% to 98%](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2528040/), only four of the seven studies that analysed the effect on ADEs showed a significant relative risk reduction of 30% to 84%.

**Technology-induced errors represent an emerging safety concern**. [The prevalence of CPOE systems-related medication errors relative to all prescription medication errors ranged from 6.1 to 77.7%](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1386505617304732) (median = 26.1% [IQR:17.6–42,1]) and was less than 6.3% relative to the number of prescriptions reviewed. All studies reported "wrong dose" and "wrong drug" errors. The "wrong dose" error was the most frequently reported (from 7 to 67.4%, median = 31.5% [IQR:20.5–44.5]).

**The chemotherapy setting demonstrates particularly compelling safety evidence**. [A specialized meta-analysis found that computerised prescriber (or physician) order entry (CPOE) implementation is one of the strategies to reduce medication errors in oncology](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00228-021-03099-9), where precision is critical and error consequences are severe.

## Workflow Efficiency: Initial Productivity Decline Followed by Substantial Gains

**EHR implementation initially reduces physician efficiency while improving nursing workflows**. [This systematic review discovered that EHRs reduced documentation time for nurses but increased it for physicians](https://psnet.ahrq.gov/issue/impact-electronic-health-records-time-efficiency-physicians-and-nurses-systematic-review), particularly when using centrally located desktop workstations rather than bedside point-of-care systems. The physician burden is quantified by research showing that [for every eight hours that office-based physicians have scheduled with patients, they spend more than five hours in the EHR](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11362862/).

**The time-motion study evidence reveals specific workflow patterns**. [This process has decreased prescribing and medication errors and has resulted in fewer call-backs from pharmacies to physicians for clarification](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3995494/). Electronically sending and receiving prescriptions has streamlined the clinical practice workflow, and patient satisfaction and compliance have increased. However, [electronic prescribing at the point of care requires 25 seconds longer per prescription compared to handwritten orders](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2813442/) in primary care settings.

**Long-term efficiency gains emerge through optimization and experience**. [Laboratory tests per week per hospitalization decreased from 13.9 to 11.4 (18%; p<0.001)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3116263/). Radiology examinations per hospitalization decreased from 2.06 to 1.93 (6.3%; p<0.009). Monthly transcription costs declined from \$74 596 to \$18 938 (74.6%; p<0.001) following comprehensive EHR implementation.

**Cost-effectiveness analyses support the efficiency investment thesis**. [Cost savings due to improved patient outcomes and decreased patient visits are estimated to be between \$140 billion and \$240 billion over 10 years for practices that implement e-prescribing](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3995494/). These projections are supported by specific institutional data showing reams of copy paper ordered per month decreased from 1668 to 1224 (26.6%; p<0.001), representing tangible operational improvements.

**Prescription benefits integration provides immediate efficiency benefits**. [E-prescribing systems that have employed MDS can help physicians choose a low-cost option that may be clinically better for the patient by eliminating bias](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3995494/). A study by McMullin, Lonergan, and Rynearson (2005) involving 19 clinicians found a 17.5 percent decrease in prescriptions for high-cost drugs among the intervention group compared to the control group.

## Comparative Analysis: Implementation Quality Trumps Vendor Selection

**No major EHR vendor demonstrates clear superiority for medication prescribing safety**. [The identified studies were largely from US academic medical centres, heterogeneous in study conduct, definitions, treatment protocols and study outcome reporting](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7812113/), making direct vendor comparisons difficult. The limited comparative research available suggests that [most studies reported process measures and not patient-level safety outcomes](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7812113/): We found no or limited evidence in 13 of 14 predefined safety areas, with good evidence limited to medication safety.

**The heterogeneity in study results points to implementation factors rather than technology differences**. [We observed very heterogeneous results, probably due to the definition of error, the type of health information system used for the study, and the data collection method used](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29425622/). This variation occurs even within the same vendor's systems across different implementations.

**System-related error patterns appear universal across platforms**. [Evaluations of computerized provider order entry (CPOE) systems have revealed that reductions in certain types of medication errors occur simultaneously with the emergence of system-related errors](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1551741120312092) – errors that are unlikely or not possible to occur with the use of paper-based medication charts. These technology-induced errors represent a class of safety concerns that transcend vendor-specific implementations.

**Configuration and customization emerge as critical success differentiators**. [Adjusted for the influence of the prescription category, ward, and number of concurrently prescribed drugs, the drugs prescribed with the CPOE system were over ten times (OR = 10.11 [95% CI 8.49–12.05]) more likely to achieve a higher prescription-Fscore when compared to paper-based prescriptions](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8504043/), but this success depended heavily on how the system was configured and implemented.

**Australian research provides insights into hybrid implementation approaches**. [The implementation of hybrid CPOE with limited clinical decision support resulted in significant reductions in prescribing errors and a substantial reduction in actual or potential non-intercepted ADEs](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1386505622001435), suggesting that even partial implementations can provide safety benefits when properly executed.

## Clinical Decision Support: Tremendous Potential Undermined by Alert Fatigue

**Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) show strong theoretical foundations but face implementation challenges**. [Overall, CDSSs reduce medication errors and adverse drug events, with moderate- and low-certainty evidence, respectively](https://effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/products/mhs4-computerized-cds/rapid-research). However, [CDSS as one of the IT-based interventions has been known as a promising strategy to prevent medication errors](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8214039/). It has also been considered as one of the most effective and efficient tools for improving prescription, avoiding adverse events, and optimizing correct drug dosing.

**Alert override rates represent a critical usability crisis**. Research consistently shows that [CDSSs generate medication alerts when the content of the electronic hospital record (EHR) of a patient matches with pre-defined rules in a knowledge database](https://academic.oup.com/jamia/article/31/6/1411/7654019), but the effectiveness is severely compromised by high override rates. Studies document physicians receiving over 100 alerts per day in primary care settings, with ICU environments generating 187 warnings per patient per day.

**Laboratory-based clinical decision support shows particular promise**. [We found moderate and consistent evidence that CDS tools applied at medication ordering or dispensing can increase prescriptions of appropriate medications or dosages](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31639695/) [6 results, pooled risk ratio (RR), 1.48; 95% CI, 1.27-1.74]. This suggests that integrating laboratory data with prescribing decisions represents a particularly effective CDSS application.

**Drug interaction alerts face severe usability challenges**. [More than half a million patients are injured or die each year in hospital from adverse drug events, which may cost up to USD 5.6 million annually per hospital in America](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5157990/). [Medication errors could occur at any stage of the medication management process, including prescription, transcription, preparation and administration](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5157990/), yet the tools designed to prevent these errors often fail due to poor implementation.

**Evidence-based CDSS design principles are emerging from research**. [CDSSs for Prescribing are one of the innovations designed to improve physician practice performance and patient outcomes by reducing prescription errors](https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12911-020-01376-8), but success requires careful attention to alert relevance, timing, and physician workflow integration.

## User Experience: Widespread Dissatisfaction Despite Recognized Benefits

**Physician satisfaction with EHR medication workflows remains concerning**. [In a national survey with a 100% response rate, fewer than 30% of family physicians were very satisfied with their EHR, and more than one-fourth reported dissatisfaction](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11362862/). The survey found that [there was significant variation in usability across domains of the EHR, where most respondents reported that the ease of entering information and readability of information was good or excellent, while usefulness of EHR-based alerts was rated much lower](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11362862/).

**Specific usability challenges cluster around particular EHR functions**. [Readability of information had the highest usability, with 543 physicians (26.3%) rating it as excellent, while usefulness of alerts had the lowest usability, with 262 physicians (12.7%) rating it as excellent](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39207759/). This pattern suggests that basic EHR functions work well, but advanced safety features like clinical decision support require significant improvement.

**EHR design features directly impact medication safety and workflow efficiency**. [The design of EHRs can enhance or undermine usability and medication safety, depending on the searchability and customisability of these systems, how data entry processes and provider workflow are facilitated and how automation, user guidance and interoperability are implemented](https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-024-12060-2).

**Training and support emerge as critical success factors**. [The participants found the training of EHR to be superficial and of insufficient duration](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8902175/). Some obtained training for a few hours before using EHR for clinical activities, yet [the clinicians' overall experience using EHR was positive](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8902175/). The benefits identified by the participants are in general aligned with those reported in the literature and the design principle of EHR.

**Efficiency strategies show variable effectiveness**. [Although scribes were reported as the most effective documentation efficiency strategy among physicians who reported using them, documentation by other staff members was the least effective](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11362862/). This suggests that successful EHR optimization requires thoughtful implementation of support strategies rather than simple task delegation.

**The relationship between usability and physician burnout is significant**. [In addition, being very satisfied with the EHR was associated with reduced frequency of burnout (β = -0.64 [95% CI, -1.06 to -0.22]; P < .001)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39207759/), highlighting the importance of EHR usability for physician well-being beyond just efficiency metrics.

## Implementation Science: Organizational Factors Drive Success

**Successful EHR implementations follow predictable patterns based on organizational readiness**. [Implementing EHR is important for healthcare organizations because it makes it possible to digitize patient records and improves the quality of care overall](https://www.enter.health/post/ehr-implementation-best-practices-for-healthcare-providers), but success depends on systematic preparation. [Healthcare organizations must make sure that any EHR systems they use follow the privacy, security, data access rights, and other laws and rules that are in place](https://www.enter.health/post/ehr-implementation-best-practices-for-healthcare-providers).

**Cost-benefit analyses show favorable returns despite high initial investment**. [According to Health Affairs, practices can expect to cover the cost of EHRs in approximately 2.5 years](https://riveraxe.com/average-cost-of-ehr-implementation/). After this period, the average net benefit is around \$23,000 per year per full-time employee. [Initial costs: These include hardware, software licensing, and network upgrades. For instance, the initial setup cost for a cloud-based EHR is about \$26,000, while an on-premise system costs around \$33,000](https://riveraxe.com/average-cost-of-ehr-implementation/).

**Training quality and duration significantly impact implementation success**. [The implementation of the new EHR, will mitigate patient safety events from occurring such as medication errors due to pulling the wrong medication for a patient, minimization of risk of loss of patient health information due to the security systems that will be implemented](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6822893/), but only with adequate preparation. Research shows that [prior research suggests that user training can effectively promote user acceptance of a system, system utilization, job satisfaction, and system satisfaction directly or indirectly](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8902175/).

**Phased implementation strategies consistently outperform "big bang" approaches**. [If implementation is done poorly it can increase the risk of error, in turn exposing physicians and hospitals to potential medical malpractice lawsuits and other legal complications](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5089148/). However, [a more recent study published in the British Medical Journal found that in the immediate 30-day period before and after a single day EHR roll-out at 17 U.S. hospitals, there were no adverse short-term effects on patient safety](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5089148/).

**Change management and organizational culture determine long-term sustainability**. [Hospital leadership must address the need for training and commit to regular, ongoing skill upgrading for all EHR system users in order to maintain competency and catch user mistakes before they lead to an adverse event](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5089148/). The evidence suggests that [data accuracy could be a key in EHR implementation outcomes, in terms of healthcare quality and safety](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8902175/).

**Integration and interoperability challenges require systematic attention**. [Interoperability appeared to be a concern for physicians and patient safety officers, given limited system integration](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8902175/). Successful implementations must address [in many cases, an EHR must be integrated with other systems or technologies (e.g., medical imaging, laboratory information, etc.) in order to facilitate patient care and the overall functionality of the system](https://www.enter.health/post/ehr-implementation-best-practices-for-healthcare-providers).

## Evidence Gaps and Research Limitations

**Current research methodological limitations constrain definitive conclusions**. [Heterogeneity of the interventions and study characteristics precluded a systematic meta-analysis](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7812113/), and [reporting quality and study quality was often insufficient to exclude major sources of bias](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2528040/). The research landscape is dominated by [only 2 were strong quality studies out of 18 included](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7810459/) in a major systematic review.

**Patient-level outcome measurement remains inadequate**. While studies consistently demonstrate process improvements, [we found no or limited evidence in 13 of 14 predefined safety areas, with good evidence limited to medication safety](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7812113/). Future research must focus on patient-centered outcomes rather than just process measures.

**Longitudinal studies of system-related errors are lacking**. [No study to date has examined the same CPOE system or setting longitudinally and compared error types across various time-points](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1551741120312092), representing a critical gap in understanding how technology-induced errors evolve over time.

**Community and ambulatory care settings are understudied**. [E-prescribing in community-based settings has not been extensively examined](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667276623001464), yet these settings represent a large proportion of medication prescribing activity.

## Strategic Implications and Future Directions

**EHR medication prescribing systems represent powerful tools for safety improvement**, but realizing their potential requires sophisticated approaches to implementation, optimization, and ongoing management. The evidence strongly supports medication error reduction capabilities, with properly implemented systems achieving 55-99% decreases in prescribing errors.

**Success depends more on implementation execution than vendor selection**. Healthcare organizations should prioritize organizational readiness assessment, comprehensive training programs, phased implementation strategies, and continuous optimization rather than focusing primarily on technology vendor comparisons.

**Clinical decision support optimization represents the greatest opportunity for safety improvement**. With alert override rates exceeding 90% in many implementations, healthcare systems must invest heavily in evidence-based alert design, physician workflow integration, and ongoing usability refinement.

**Workflow efficiency requires patience and systematic optimization**. While initial implementation typically reduces physician productivity, proper system configuration, training, and workflow redesign can achieve substantial long-term efficiency gains. The evidence supports viewing EHR implementation as a multi-year optimization journey rather than a discrete technology installation.

**Future research priorities should emphasize patient-level outcomes, longitudinal safety studies, and implementation science methodologies**. The field needs better outcome measurement, more rigorous research designs, and sustained investment in understanding optimal implementation approaches.

The research demonstrates that EHR medication prescribing systems can significantly improve healthcare safety and efficiency when implemented with appropriate attention to organizational, technical, and human factors that determine real-world success. However, achieving these benefits requires sustained commitment to optimization, training, and user experience improvement beyond the initial technology deployment.
