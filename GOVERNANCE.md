# Project Governance

## Overview

This document describes the governance model for GenPRES, a medical decision support system for medication safety in pediatrics. As medical device software, GenPRES requires robust governance to ensure patient safety, regulatory compliance, and sustainable development.

## Project Vision

GenPRES aims to provide safe, accurate, and reliable medication dosing calculations for pediatric patients, reducing medication errors and improving patient outcomes through evidence-based decision support.

## Governance Principles

1. **Patient Safety First**: All decisions prioritize patient safety and clinical accuracy
2. **Regulatory Compliance**: Adherence to MDR, ISO 14971, IEC 62304, and applicable standards
3. **Transparency**: Open decision-making processes and clear documentation
4. **Evidence-Based**: Clinical decisions grounded in scientific literature and guidelines
5. **Community Inclusion**: Welcoming contributions while maintaining quality standards
6. **Quality Over Speed**: Thorough review and validation before releases

## Decision-Making Process

### Routine Decisions

**Examples**: Bug fixes, minor features, documentation updates, refactoring

**Process:**

1. Contributor submits PR
2. Automated checks pass (tests, formatting, linting)
3. Code review by at least one maintainer
4. Clinical review if safety-related
5. Maintainer approval and merge

**Timeline**: Typically 3-7 days

### Significant Changes

**Examples**: New major features, API changes, architectural changes, dependency updates

**Process:**

1. RFC (Request for Comments) discussion in GitHub Discussions or issue
2. Design review with core maintainers
3. Clinical review if applicable
4. Consensus among maintainers (not unanimous, but no strong objections)
5. Implementation via PR with standard review process

**Timeline**: Typically 1-4 weeks

### Safety-Critical Changes

**Examples**: Dosing algorithms, unit conversions, constraint solving, risk control measures

**Process:**

1. RFC with clinical justification and literature references
2. Technical design review
3. **Mandatory clinical advisor review**
4. Risk assessment update
5. Enhanced testing requirements
6. Multiple maintainer approvals
7. Validation testing before merge

**Timeline**: Typically 2-8 weeks (may require additional validation)

### Major Strategic Decisions

**Examples**: Regulatory strategy, major technology changes, licensing changes

**Process:**

1. Proposal document by project lead or maintainer
2. Discussion period (minimum 2 weeks)
3. Input from all stakeholders
4. Final decision by project lead
5. Documentation in Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

**Timeline**: Varies based on complexity

## Consensus Building

We use **lazy consensus** for most decisions:

- Proposals are assumed accepted if no objections within reasonable timeframe
- Explicit approval not always required
- Objections must be raised with reasoning
- Attempt to address concerns and find compromise
- Project lead makes final decision if consensus cannot be reached

For safety-critical changes, **explicit approval** is required from:

- At least one core maintainer
- At least one clinical advisor
- Project lead (for high-risk changes)

## Conflict Resolution

1. **Direct Communication**: Contributors are encouraged to resolve conflicts directly
2. **Maintainer Mediation**: If unresolved, maintainers help facilitate discussion
3. **Project Lead Decision**: Final authority rests with project lead
4. **Code of Conduct**: All conflicts handled per [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## Becoming a Maintainer

### Criteria

- Sustained contributions over 6+ months
- Deep technical knowledge of relevant areas
- Demonstrated understanding of medical device requirements
- High-quality code reviews
- Positive community engagement
- Commitment to project values and patient safety

### Process

1. Nomination by existing maintainer or self-nomination
2. Discussion among core team
3. Consensus approval
4. Onboarding and access provisioning

### Maintainer Emeritus

Maintainers who step back retain emeritus status:

- Recognition of past contributions
- Advisory capacity if desired
- Can return to active maintainer status

## Pull Request Review Process

### Standard PRs

- **Required**: 1 maintainer approval
- **Optional**: Additional reviews welcome
- **Automated**: Tests, linting, formatting checks must pass
- **Clinical review**: Required if safety-related

### Clinical/Safety PRs

- **Required**: 1 maintainer + 1 clinical advisor approval
- **Risk assessment**: Update if risk profile changes
- **Testing**: Enhanced test requirements
- **Documentation**: Update MDR documentation if needed

### Breaking Changes

- **RFC required**: Discussion before implementation
- **Deprecation policy**: Follow semantic versioning
- **Migration guide**: Document upgrade path
- **Major version bump**: Required for breaking changes

## Release Authority

**Release Manager**: Project Lead or designated maintainer

**Release Process:**

1. All tests passing
2. MDR documentation updated
3. CHANGELOG.md updated
4. Version number per semantic versioning
5. Risk management review
6. Release notes prepared
7. Tag and publish
